Some Klipper and SuperSlicer configs.

Monoprice Maker Select - Wanhao Duplicator i3 clone.  Also Cocoon
Create.  Ancient Melzi board with notabe issues.  Mine was the
version with the square box, which I suspect makes it the original.
I was running with a Le Potato off Amazon rather than an rpi, due
to the shortage.

Monoprice Maker Select Plus - Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus clone, also
Cocoon Create Touch.  Klipper doesn't drive the touch screen, because
it requires some kind of serial-port pass-through.  There is a
project out there to adapt to a similar screen:

I just got some cheap ESP32 displays and put CYD-Klipper on them:
