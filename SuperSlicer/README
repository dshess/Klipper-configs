SuperSlicer profiles I have used.

Oldschool/ - Monoprice Maker Select I used awhile back to print Voron parts.
  Oldschool.ini                       ; a printer config
  Voron Fast.ini                      ; a print config
  Polymaker ABS Black (Oldschool).ini ; a filament config
NOTE: This printer has been sitting in a pile on the floor for
around a year.  The configs above are my best guess from picking
through the config dir.

IIIP/ - Monoprice Maker Select Plus I'm using to print Bastion parts.
  Monoprice Maker Select Plus.ini  ; a printer config
  IIIP Bastion.ini                 ; a print config
  PLA - IIIP - Monoprice Black.ini ; a filament config
